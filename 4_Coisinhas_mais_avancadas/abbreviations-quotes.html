        <blockquote cite="https://www.nps.gov/mlkm/learn/quotations.htm">
            <p> If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical rather
            than sectional. Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our
            nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective. </p>
